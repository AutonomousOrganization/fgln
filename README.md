Plugin and library that uses graph Library fgl to load lightning network into functional data structure and create some convenience functions (in progress) 

Current added rpc to core lightning:
- candidates -- show who will be opened to
- deploy [sats] -- deploy amount in a batch transaction to nodes far from current node
- network -- show network stats
- route [n1, n2, amt, num] -- breath first search for all routes between n1 & n2
